== Resizing ==

* goals:
  * box layout containers:
    * fit content on one dimension, full width/height on another
      * example: accordions
    * even/fraction divide
      * strict or lenient?
      * example: menu screens
    * rubber table?
    * scroller - can take any size, can fit any size
    * proportional resizer (takes any size, stretches while preserving proportion of one child)?
      * example: main menu buttons

* a minimum root window size (640x480), to avoid ridiculous layout issues
  * we could let content of all windows dictate minimum size, but added controls could no longer fit
* shrink resizes might fail?
  * divide and conquer search for minimum acceptable size?

* resize events:
  * inbound (container resize, e.g. due to resolution change)
  * outbound, when container fits content
    * e.g. expanding a collapsed box inside an accordion
    * only inside scrollable containers?
  * an inbound event shouldn't result in an outbound event
